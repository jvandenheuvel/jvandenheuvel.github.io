                        <p>Path of Exile is an ARPG that you play with seven different characters. These characters all have different strengths and starting points on the passive tree which will be explained in another part. </p>
                        <p>This stage of selecting characters is just a play and go scenario until you gain understanding of the game and the characters. The characters are split up into 3 main different attribute parts which are Intelligence, Strength, and Dexterity. Each and every character are given bonus starts and extra attributes to start the game and it allows the user to build around those attributes.</p>

                        <p>Once you have selected a character it is advised to see what base this character is aswell; Melee, Range, Mage. This will allow you to pick the proper gem to start with and progress with.</p>
                        <p>Skills in this game use both the attributes of strength, dexterity, and intelligence as well as the three attack types. A lot of the gems will be given to the character you selected from the missions you complete. Every skill in this game can progress to endgame with ease but some take more knowledge to micromanage and theorycraft. Going this far, you will move into linking that main skill with gems that support it. Again only some supports will work with each skill, which means you have to trial what gems work.</p>

                        <p>As you progress you tend to feel either a growth of speed or lack of speed. As you level up you begin to make the skill tree based off of what kind of playstyle you want such as a safe playstyle, or a fast glass cannon. Once you become more experienced with the game, you will adjust your skill tree to your desired play style.</p>

                        <p>Finally when it comes to end game content you want to have a general understanding of the mechanics and are able to stay alive through your knowledge and better gear. Currency is the main strive for playing this game towards endgame as well as the accomplishment of getting a high level. Mapping is a big time consuption in endgame but is very rewarding because it is the best source of currency and gear for your character. As you progress in maps and continue to get your character to a high level, theres other challenges and bosses to be dealt with if there is ever a problem with boredom.</p>
